# Food Allergy Inspector (Food AI)

## Inspiration / Project Description
All of us had friends who have food allergies - serious or mild - so we wanted to develop a project that will help make their lives easier. 
Eating out is not as easy for our friends with food allergies. They have to be very careful about what is in the dishes that they are consuming. 
Unfortunately, it is not as easy to tell 


## Inspector
With Food AI, you'll be able to upload a photo of the dish or enter the name of the dish. The model will recognize the photo or the name and give you common ingredients in that particular dish. It will also give you an alert if the ingredients include any of the 8 common food allergies.

## News
Latest news regarding food allergies and food-borne illnesses. (food recalls)

## Remodel
Currently, our model is only built with 101 different types of dishes. With 'Remodel', users will be able to train the model to learn new dishes and to improve the accuracy of image recognition.
